# Introduction {#Introduction}

The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) {{I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc}} defines a header compression scheme 
and fragmentation functionality, both specially tailored for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) networks defined in 
{{RFC8376}}.  

Header compression is needed to efficiently bring Internet connectivity to the node within an NB-IoT network. SCHC uses a static context to performs header compression with specific parameters that need to be adapted into the NB-IoT wireless access. This document assumes functionality for NB-IoT of 3GPP release 15 otherwise other versions functionality is explicitly mentioned in the text.

This document describes the use of SCHC and its parameterizing over the NB-IoT wireless access.

The architecture for 3GPP LTE network has been reused for NB-IoT with some optimizations and simplifications known as Cellular IoT (CIoT). Considering the typical use cases for CIoT devices here are described some of the additions to the LTE architecture specific for CIoT. C-SGN(CIoT Serving Gateway Node) is a deployment option co-locating EPS entities in the control plane and user plane paths (for example, MME + SGW + P-GW) and the external interfaces of the entities supported. The C-SGN also supports at least some of the following CIoT EPS Optimizations:
*    Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimization for small data transmission.
*    User Plane CIoT EPS Optimization for small data transmission.
*    Necessary security procedures for efficient small data transmission.
*    SMS without combined attach for NB-IoT only UEs.
*    Paging optimizations for coverage enhancements.
*    Support for non-IP data transmission via SGi tunneling and/or SCEF.
*    Support for Attach without PDN (Packet Data Network) connectivity.

Another node introduced in the CIOT architecture is the SCEF (Service Capability Exposure Function) that provide means to securely expose service and network capabilities to entities external to the network operator. The northbound APIS are defined by OMA and OneM2M. The main functions of a SCEF are:
* Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) established through the SCEF.
* Monitoring and exposure of event related to UE reachability, loss of connectivity, location reporting, roaming status, communication failure and change of IMEI-IMSI association.

## Data Transmission
3GPP networks deal not only with data transmitted end-to-end but also with in-band signaling that is used between the nodes and functions to configure, control and monitor the system functions and behaviors. The control data is handled using a Control Plane which has a specific set of protocols, handling processes and entities. In contrast, the end-to-end or user data utilize a User Plane with characteristics of its own separated from the Control Plane. The handling and setup of the Control Plane and User Plane spans over the whole 3GPP network and it has particular implications in the radio network (i.e., EUTRAN) and in the packet core (ex., EPC).

For the CIOT cases, additionally to transmissions of data over User Plane, 3GPP has specified optimizations for small data transmissions that allow transporting user data (IP, Non-IP) within signaling on the access network (Data transmission over Control Plane or Data Over NAS).

The maximum recommended MTU size is 1358 Bytes. The radio network protocols limit the packet sizes to be transmitted over the air including radio protocol overhead to 1600 Octets. But the value is reduced further to avoid fragmentation in the backbone of the network due to the payload encryption size (multiple of 16) and handling of the additional core transport overhead.


SCHC could be deployed differently depending on the placing of the entities in the architecture. NB-IoT and in general the cellular technologies interfaces are standardized by 3GPP.  Therefore the introduction of SCHC entities in the RAN (Radio Access Network) would require support from both the network and terminal entities.  If SCHC entities are to be placed in RAN it would require to be added to be specified as an option for the UE - Base Station/C-SGN interfaces. 

Another option is to place the SCHC entities in the applications layer, and the SCHC packets would be transmitted as non-IP packets. 
The first option allows the deployment of IP for routing and addressing as well. 

There are four different scenarios where SCHC maybe used in the NB-IoT architecture, the following sections will describe each one:

### IP data on the User Plane (PDCP layer)

In this architecture the header compression is done between the Terminal and the e-NB where the low bandwidth channels are established, SCHC is performed in the PDCP layer. There are three different L2 (RLC) modes, that bring different levels of reliability to the transmission in the User Plane.

The mode used depends on the operator configuration for the type of data to be transmitted.  For example, data transmissions supporting mobility or requiring high reliability would be most likely configured using AM, meanwhile streaming and real-time data would be mapped to a UM configuration.

* In Transparent Mode. SCHC header compression and fragmentation may be used. In this mode, the RLC layer does not add any reliable to the channel.
* In Unacknowledged Mode. SCHC header compression/decompression and fragmentation/assembly may be used. Even if the RLC layer performs a segmentation/concatenation in this mode. Because when there are changes in the radio conditions and  triggering the selection
  of a smaller transport block, the segmentation is not adapted. However, the use of SCHC fragmentation/assembly may improve the behavior in this case. 
* In Acknowledge Mode. SCHC header compression/decompression may be used only. In this mode, the RLC layer also performs segmentation and concatenation behavior.

#### NB-IoT Channels
(Rule ID on L2)

TBD

#### Static Context Header Compression

The context is initialized during the channel opening between the UE and the MME which define the context to be used based on the HSS information of the user profile. 

##### SCHC Rules
Rules are defined based on the IP/UDP packets, there may be a necessary amount of Rules to cover the different scenarios of IP addresses.
The definition of these Rules is based on the Service Provider Network, the Device may have at least some Rules for IPv4, some for IPv6.


##### Rule ID 
The Rule ID the SCHC identifies are:
* In the SCHC C/D context the Rule used to keep the Field Description of the header packet. 

* In SCHC Fragmentation the specific modes and settings.

* And at least one Rule ID may be reserved to the case where no SCHC C/D nor SCHC fragmentation were possible.

TBD


##### SCHC MAX_PACKET_SIZE

* In Transparent Mode  TBD
* In Unacknowledged Mode TBD
* In Acknowledge Mode TBD

TBD

#### Fragmentation
The RLC layer of NB-IoT can segment packets in suitable units that fit the selected transport blocks for transmissions of the physical layer.
The selection of the blocks is done according to the input of the link adaptation function in the MAC layer and the quantity of data in the buffer. 
The link adaptation layer may produce different results at each Time Transmission Interval (TTI) for what is very difficult to set a fragmentation value according to the transport block that is selected for each transmission. 
Instead for NB-IoT SCHC must take care of keeping the application packets with a suitable size that do not exceed the MTU (1600 bytes).

##### Fragmentation in Transparent Mode
For the Transparent Mode, the ACK-Always mode may be used. In these kinds of channels there may be out of order delivery and losses, ACK-Always can bring a good solution to increase reliability in this kind of channels. 
Nevertheless, if the transmission needs to be non-reliable No-ACK maybe use too. 

##### Fragmentation in Unacknowledged Mode
In Unacknowledged Mode, the channel may bring some more reliable transmission,  the ACK-on-Error could be a solution when the characteristic of the channel change and the segmentation is not adapted.

TBD

##### Fragmentation Parameters in Transparent Mode

* Rule ID

* DTag

* FCN

* Retransmission Timer

* Inactivity Timer

* MAX_ACK_Retries

* MAX_ATTEMPS

TBD

##### Fragmentation Parameters in Unacknowledged Mode

* Rule ID

* DTag

* FCN

* Retransmission Timer

* Inactivity Timer

* MAX_ACK_Retries

* MAX_ATTEMPS

TBD

### IP Data Over Control Plane
The Non-Access Stratum (NAS), conveys mainly control signaling between the UE and the cellular network [TGPP24301].
The NAS makes the lower layer transparent to the transmission as a tunnel. And so in this case, either SCHC C/D and F/A are deployed between the User Equipment and the C-SGN (service in the MME) or
SCHC header compression and fragmentation are done E2E from the UE to the PGW where the tunnel ends before going to the Application Server.

{: #Fig--ProtocolArchi2 title="3GPP CIOT radio protocol architecture for DoNAS transmissions"} 

Depending on the data type signaled indication (IP or non-IP data), the network allocates an IP address or just establish a direct forwarding path. 
DoNAS (Data over NAS)  is regulated under rate control upon previous agreement, meaning that a maximum number of bits per unit of time is agreed per device subscription beforehand and configured in the device. 
The use of DoNAS is typically expected when a terminal in a power saving state requires to do a short transmission and receive an acknowledgment or short feedback from the network.
 Depending on the size of buffered data to transmit, the UE might be instructed to deploy the connected mode transmissions instead, limiting and controlling the DoNAS transmissions to predefined thresholds and a good resource optimization balance for the terminal and the network. 
 The support for mobility of DoNAS is present but produces additional overhead.

#### NB-IoT Channels
(Rule ID on L2)
The channel between the Device and the MME is open during the negotiation of the channel, during this process, the context is initialized.

TBD

#### Static Context Header Compression

TBD

##### SCHC Rules
In the Control plane, an IP packet may be sent, it can use IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. In the context,  some Rules for IPv4 and some for IPv6 may be defined using the most common values.

##### Rule ID 

TBD

##### SCHC MAX_PACKET_SIZE
TBD

#### Fragmentation
The SCHC fragmentation solution will improve the performance of this transmission because it includes some reliability options. 
In this use case, the ACK-on-Error mode seems to be more adapted, the windows will let to send a complete IP packet over this tiny packet of 2Kbytes.
 
TBD

##### Fragmentation Parameters
* Rule ID

* DTag

* FCN

* Retransmission Timer

* Inactivity Timer

* MAX_ACK_Retries

* MAX_ATTEMPS

TBD


### NoIP Data over SGI Tunneling
Application Payload may be carried from the UE through the control plane using the CSGN tunnel. As it is purely payload so SCHC can be used to fragment the information from the UE to the PGW.

#### NB-IoT Channels
(Rule ID on L2)

TBD

#### Fragmentation

IF the channel allows some feedback the ACK-on-Error mode may be used. IF not the No-ACK mode will bring a good solution for this channel.

##### Fragmentation Parameters
* Rule ID. The use of a special Rule ID where only fragmentation is performed may be used in this case. 

* DTag

* FCN

* Retransmission Timer

* Inactivity Timer

* MAX_ACK_Retries

* MAX_ATTEMPS

TBD


### NoIP over SCEF
The MME opens a dedicated channel between the UE and the SCEF gateway, where the SCHC fragmentation can be used. 


#### NB-IoT Channels
(Rule ID on L2)

TBD

#### Fragmentation
IF the channel allows some feedback the ACK-on-Error mode may be used. IF not the No-ACK mode will bring a good solution for this channel.

##### Fragmentation Parameters
* Rule ID. The use of a special Rule ID where only fragmentation is performed may be used in this case. 

* DTag

* FCN

* Retransmission Timer

* Inactivity Timer

* MAX_ACK_Retries

* MAX_ATTEMPS

TBD

# Padding
NB-IoT and 3GPP wireless access, in general, assumes byte aligned payload. Therefore the L2 word for NB-IoT MUST be considered 8 bits and the treatment of padding should use this value accordingly.

# Security considerations
3GPP access security is specified in (TGPP33203).
