# Introduction {#Introduction}

The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) {{I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc}} defines a header compression scheme 
and fragmentation functionality, both specially tailored for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) networks defined in 
{{RFC8376}}.  

Header compression is needed to efficiently bring Internet connectivity to the node within an NB-IoT network. SCHC uses a static context to performs header compression with specific parameters that need to be adapted into the NB-IoT wireless access. This document assumes functionality for NB-IoT of 3GPP release 15 otherwise other versions functionality is explicitly mentioned in the text.

This document describes the use of SCHC and its parameterizing over the NB-IoT wireless access.

The architecture for 3GPP LTE network has been reused for NB-IoT with some optimizations and simplifications known as Cellular IoT (CIoT). Considering the typical use cases for CIoT devices here are described some of the additions to the LTE architecture specific for CIoT. C-SGN(CIoT Serving Gateway Node) is a deployment option co-locating EPS entities in the control plane and user plane paths (for example, MME + SGW + P-GW) and the external interfaces of the entities supported. The C-SGN also supports at least some of the following CIoT EPS Optimizations:

* Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimization for small data transmission.
* User Plane CIoT EPS Optimization for small data transmission.
* Necessary security procedures for efficient small data transmission.
* SMS without combined attach for NB-IoT only UEs.
* Paging optimizations for coverage enhancements.
* Support for non-IP data transmission via SGi tunneling and/or SCEF.
* Support for Attach without PDN (Packet Data Network) connectivity.

Another node introduced in the CIOT architecture is the SCEF (Service Capability Exposure Function) that provide means to securely expose service and network capabilities to entities external to the network operator. The northbound APIS are defined by OMA and OneM2M. The main functions of a SCEF are:
* Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) established through the SCEF.
* Monitoring and exposure of event related to UE reachability, loss of connectivity, location reporting, roaming status, communication failure and change of IMEI-IMSI association.

# Data Transmission
3GPP networks deal not only with data transmitted end-to-end but also with in-band signaling that is used between the nodes and functions to configure, control and monitor the system functions and behaviors. The control data is handled using a Control Plane which has a specific set of protocols, handling processes and entities. In contrast the end-to-end or user data utilize a User Plane with characteristics of its own separated from the Control Plane. The handling and setup of the Control Plane and User Plane spans over the whole 3GPP network and it has particular implications in the radio network (i.e., EUTRAN) and in the packet core (ex., EPC).

For the CIOT cases, additionally to transmissions of data over User Plane, 3GPP has specified optimizations for small data transmissions, allowing to transport user data (IP, Non-IP) within signaling on the access network (Data transmission over Control Plane or Data Over NAS).

The maximum recommended MTU size is 1358 Bytes. The radio network protocols limit the packet sizes to be transmitted over the air including radio protocol overhead to 1600 Octets. But the value is reduced further to avoid fragmentation in the backbone of the network due to the payload encryption size (multiple of 16) and handling of the additional core transport overhead.

NB-IoT and in general the cellular technologies interfaces and functions are standardized by 3GPP. Therefore the introduction of SCHC entities to UE, eNB and C-SGN does need to be specified in the NB-IoT standard. This implies that standard specified SCHC support would not be backwards compatible. A terminal or a network supporting a version of the standard without support of SCHC or without capability implementation (in case of not being standardized as mandatory capability) is not able to utilize the compression services with this approach.

SCHC can be deployed differently depending on where the header compression is to be applied. The compression could be applied to the packets about to be transmitted over the air, or to the whole end-to-end link. To accomplish the first, it is required to place SCHC compression and decompression entities in the eNB and in the UE for transmissions over the User Plane. Additionally, to handle the case of the transmissions over Control Plane or Data Over NAS, the network SCHC entity has to be placed in the C-SGN as well. For these two cases, the functions are to be standardized by 3GPP.

Another possibility is to apply compression to the end-to-end connection or at least up to the operator network edge. In that case, the SCHC entities would be placed in the application layer of the terminal in one end, and either in the application servers or in a broker function in the edge of the operator network in the other end. For the radio network, the packets are transmitted as non-IP traffic, which can be currently served utilizing IP tunneling or SCEF services. Since this option does not necessarily require 3GPP standardization, it is possible to also benefit legacy devices with SCHC by utilizing the non-IP transmission features of the operator network.
																														 

Accordingly, there are four different scenarios where SCHC can be used in the NB-IoT architecture. IP header compression on the data transmission over User Plane, IP header compression on the optimized transmissions over Control Plane (i.e.,DoNAS), non-IP transmissions of SCHC packets by IP tunneling, and non-IP transmissions of SCHC packets by SCEF forwarding. The following sections describe each of them in more detail. The first two scenarios refer to transmissions using the 3GPP IP transmission capabilities and the last two refers to transmission using the Non-IP capabilities.

							
# IP based Data Transmission
## SCHC over User Plane transmissions
Deploying SCHC only over the radio link would require to place it as part of the User Plane data transmission. The User Plane utilizes the protocol stack of the Access Stratum (AS) for data transfer.  AS (Access Stratum) is the functional layer responsible for transporting data over wireless connection and managing radio resources. The user plane AS has support for features such as reliability, segmentation and concatenation. The transmissions of the AS utilize link adaptation, meaning that the transport format utilized for the transmissions are optimized according to the radio conditions, the number of bits to transmit and the power and interference constrains. That means that the number of bits transmitted over the air depends of the Modulation and Coding Schemes (MCS) selected. The transmissions in the physical layer happens at network synchronized intervals of times called TTI (Transmission Time Interval). The transmission of a Transport Block (TB) is completed during, at least, one TTI. Each Transport Block has a different MCS and number of bits available to transmit. The Transport Blocks characteristics are defined by the MAC technical specification [TGPP36321].
The Access Stratum for User Plane is comprised by Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) [TGPP36323], Radio Link Protocol (RLC)[TGPP36322], Medium Access Control protocol (MAC)[TGPP36321] and the Physical Layer [TGPP36201]. More details of this protocols are given in the Appendix.

The current architecture provides support for header compression in PDCP utilizing RoHC {{RFC5795}}. Therefore SCHC entities can be deployed in similar fashion without need for major changes in the 3GPP specifications. 

In this scenario, RLC takes care of the handling of fragmentation (if  transparent mode is not configured) when packets exceeds the transport block size at the time of transmission. Therefore SCHC fragmentation is not needed and should not be used to avoid additional protocol overhead. It is not common to configure RLC in Transparent Mode for IP based user plane data. But given the case in the future, SCHC fragmentation may be used. In that case, a SCHC tile would match the minimum transport block size minus the PDCP and MAC headers.

## Data Over Control Plane
The Non-Access Stratum (NAS), conveys mainly control signaling between the UE and the cellular network [TGPP24301]. NAS is transported on top of the Access Stratum (AS) already mentioned in the previous section.
NAS has been adapted to provide support for user plane data transmissions to reduce the overhead when transmitting infrequent small quantities of data. This is known as Data over NAS (DoNAS) or Control Plane CIoT EPS optimization. In DoNAS the UE makes use of the pre-established NAS security and piggyback uplink small data into the initial NAS uplink message, and uses an additional NAS message to receive downlink small data response.
The data encryption from the network side is performed by the C-SGN in a NAS PDU. Additional details of DoNAS are given in the Appendix.
In this scenario SCHC can be applied in the NAS protocol layer instead of PDCP. The same principles than for user plane transmissions applies here as well. The main difference is the physical placing of the SCHC entities in the network side as the C-SGN (placed in the core network) is the terminating node for NAS instead of the eNB.

### Parameters for Static Context Header Compression
### SCHC Context initialization
 

#### SCHC Rules
Rules are defined based on the IP/UDP packets, there may be a necessary amount of Rules to cover the different scenarios of IP addresses.
The definition of these Rules is based on the Service Provider Network, the Device may have at least some Rules for IPv4, some for IPv6.
							

#### Rule ID 
The Rule ID the SCHC identifies are:

* In the SCHC C/D context the Rule used to keep the Field Description of the header packet. 

* In SCHC Fragmentation the specific modes and settings.
				

																																																																											

#### SCHC MAX_PACKET_SIZE

* In Transparent Mode  TBD
* In Unacknowledged Mode TBD
* In Acknowledge Mode TBD
																																																																											
### Fragmentation
The RLC layer of NB-IoT can segment packets in suitable units that fit the selected transport blocks for transmissions of the physical layer.
The selection of the blocks is done according to the input of the link adaptation function in the MAC layer and the quantity of data in the buffer. 
The link adaptation layer may produce different results at each Time Transmission Interval (TTI) for what is very difficult to set a fragmentation value according to the transport block that is selected for each transmission. 
Instead for NB-IoT SCHC must take care of keeping the application packets with a suitable size that do not exceed the MTU (1600 bytes).

#### Fragmentation in Transparent Mode
For the Transparent Mode, the ACK-Always mode may be used. In these kinds of channels there may be out of order delivery and losses, ACK-Always can bring a good solution to increase reliability in this kind of channels. 
Nevertheless, if the transmission needs to be non-reliable No-ACK maybe use too. 
																																																																											
# Non-IP based Data Transmission
The Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) services of 3GPP enable the possibility of transmitting SCHC packets compressed by the application layer. The packets can be delivered by means of IP-tunnels to the 3GPP network or using SCEF functions (i.e., API calls). In both cases the packet IP is not understood by the 3GPP network since it is already compressed and the network does not has information of the context used for compression. Therefore the network will treat the packet as a Non-IP traffic and deliver it to the UE without any other stack element, directly under the L2.

{: #Fig--NIDD title= 'SCHC entities placement when utilizing Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) 3GPP Services'}   

In the two scenarios using NIDD, SCHC entities are located almost in top of the stack. In the terminal, it may be implemented by a application utilizing the NB-IoT connectivity services. In the network side, the SCHC entities are located in the Application Server (AS). The IP tunneling scenario requires that the Application Server sends the compressed packet over an IP connection that is terminated by the 3GPP core network. If instead the SCEF services are used, then it is possible to utilize a API call to transfer the SCHC packets between the core network and the AS, also an IP tunnel could be established by the AS, if negotiated with the SCEF.

# Padding
NB-IoT and 3GPP wireless access in general assumes byte aligned payload. Therefore the L2 word for NB-IoT MUST be considered 8 bits and the treatment of padding should use this value accordingly.

# Security considerations
3GPP access security is specified in (TGPP33203).

## NB-IoT User Plane protocol architecture

### Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP)
Each of the  Radio Bearers (RB) are associated with one PDCP entity. And a PDCP entity is associated with one or two RLC entities depending of the unidirectional or bi-directional characteristics of the RB and RLC mode used. A PDCP entity is associated either control plane or user plane which independent configuration and functions. The maximum supported size for NB-IoT of a PDCP SDU is 1600 octets.
The main services and functions of the PDCP sublayer for NB-IoT for the user plane include:
* Header compression and decompression by means of ROHC (Robust Header Compression) 
* Transfer of user and control data to higher and lower layers
* Duplicate detection of lower layer SDUs when re-establishing connection (when RLC with Acknowledge Mode in use for User Plane only)
* Ciphering and deciphering
* Timer-based SDU discard in uplink

### Radio Link Protocol (RLC)
RLC is a layer-2 protocol that operates between the UE and the base station (eNB). It supports the packet delivery from higher layers to MAC creating packets that are transmitted over the air optimizing the Transport Block utilization.
RLC flow of data packets is unidirectional and it is composed of a transmitter located in the transmission device and a receiver located in the destination device. Therefore to configure bi-directional flows, two set of entities, one in each direction (downlink and uplink) must be configured and they are effectively peered to each other. The peering allows the transmission of control packets (ex., status reports) between entities. RLC can be configured for data transfer in one of the following modes:
* Transparent Mode (TM). In this mode RLC do not segment or concatenate SDUs from higher layers and do not include any header to the payload. When acting as a transmitter, RLC receives SDUs from upper layers and transmit directly to its flow RLC receiver via lower layers. Similarly, an TM RLC receiver would only deliver without additional processing the packets to higher layers upon reception.
* Unacknowledged Mode (UM). This mode provides support for segmentation and concatenation of payload. The size of the RLC packet depends of the indication given at a particular transmission opportunity by the lower layer (MAC) and are octets aligned. The  packet delivery to the receiver do not include support for reliability and the lost of a segment from a packet means a whole packet loss. Also in case of lower layer retransmissions there is no support for re-segmentation in case of change of the radio conditions triggering the selection of a smaller transport block. Additionally it provides PDU duplication detection and discard, reordering of out of sequence and loss detection.
* Acknowledged Mode (AM). Additional to the same functions supported from UM, this mode also adds a moving windows based reliability service on top of the lower layer services. It also provides support for re-segmentation and it requires  bidirectional communication to exchange acknowledgment reports called RLC Status Report and trigger retransmissions is needed. Protocol error detection is also supported by this mode.
The mode uses depends of the operator configuration for the type of data to be transmitted. For example, data transmissions supporting mobility or requiring high reliability would be most likely configured using AM, meanwhile streaming and real time data would be map to a UM configuration.

### Medium Access Control (MAC)
MAC provides a mapping between the higher layers abstraction called Logical Channels comprised by the previously described protocols to the Physical layer channels (transport channels). Additionally, MAC may multiplex packets from different Logical Channels and prioritize what to fit into one Transport Block if there is data and space available to maximize the efficiency of data transmission. MAC also provides error correction and reliability support by means of HARQ, transport format selection and scheduling information reporting from the terminal to the network. MAC also adds the necessary padding and piggyback control elements when possible additional to the higher layers data.

## NB-IoT Data over NAS (DoNAS)

The AS protocol stack used by DoNAS is somehow special. Since the security associations are not established yet in the radio network, to reduce the protocol overhead,  PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) is bypassed  until AS security is activated. RLC (Radio Link Control protocol) is configured by default in AM mode, but depending of the features supported by the network and the terminal it may be configured in other modes by the network operator. For example, the transparent mode does not add any header or does not process the payload in any way reducing the overhead, but the MTU would be limited by the transport block used to transmit the data which is couple of thousand of bits maximum. If UM (only Release 15 compatible terminals) is used, the RLC mechanisms of reliability is disabled and only the reliability provided by the MAC layer by Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) is available. In this case, the protocol overhead might be smaller than for the AM case because the lack of status reporting but with the same support for segmentation up to 16000 Bytes. NAS packet are encapsulated within a RRC (Radio Resource Control)[TGPP36331] message.   

Depending of the data type indication signaled (IP or non-IP data), the network allocates an IP address or just establish a direct forwarding path. DoNAS is regulated under rate control upon previous agreement, meaning that a maximum number of bits per unit of time is agreed per device subscription beforehand and configured in the device. 
The use of DoNAS is typically expected when a terminal in a power saving state requires to do a short transmission and receive an acknowledgment or short feedback from the network. Depending of the size of buffered data to transmit, the UE might be instructed to deploy the connected mode transmissions instead, limiting and controlling the DoNAS transmissions to predefined thresholds and a good resource optimization balance for the terminal and the network. The support for mobility of DoNAS is present but produces additional overhead.
